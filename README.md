# TCCS: Threaded Cognitive Context System (v1.0 Public Release)

This repository presents a conceptual architecture for managing contextual memory in large language models (LLMs), called **Threaded Cognitive Context System (TCCS)**.

TCCS aims to address key limitations in current LLMs such as catastrophic forgetting, lack of contextual continuity, and weak multi-session task segmentation.
